# Day 20 - Customer Segmentation in Tableau

## Project Overview
This project focuses on performing customer segmentation analysis using Tableau. You will apply clustering techniques to group customers based on their behavior and visualize the segments with interactive dashboards.

## Objectives
- Perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques.
- Visualize customer segments and behavioral trends in Tableau.
- Provide insights into targeted marketing strategies based on customer segments.
