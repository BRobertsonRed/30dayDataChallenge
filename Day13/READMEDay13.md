# Day 13 - Setting Up a Relational Database

## Project Overview
This project involves designing and setting up a relational database using SQL. You will learn how to create tables, define relationships, and write basic SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data.

## Objectives
- Design and implement a relational database schema.
- Create tables and define relationships using primary and foreign keys.
- Write SQL queries to insert, update, and retrieve data.

## Dataset
- **Name:** Customer Orders Database
- **Source:** [Brazilian Ecommerce Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce)
- **Description:** Historical customer order data used to design and populate a relational database.

## Steps to Complete
1. Import the dataset into your preferred SQL environment (PostgreSQL, MySQL).
2. Design the database schema, defining primary keys, foreign keys, and table relationships.
3. Create the tables and insert the data using SQL.
4. Write queries to retrieve and manipulate the data (e.g., joins, filters).
5. Document the database design and key queries in a report.

## Checklist
- [ ] Download the dataset and set up the SQL environment.
