# Day 10 - Portfolio Optimization using Markowitz Model

## Project Overview
This project involves using Python to build a portfolio optimization model based on Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). The goal is to create an efficient frontier that maximizes returns for a given level of risk.

## Objectives
- Build a portfolio optimization model using Python.
- Calculate expected returns and risks for a portfolio.
- Create an efficient frontier and optimize portfolio allocation.

## Dataset
- **Name:** Stock Market Data
- **Source:** [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/)
- **Description:** Historical stock price data used to calculate returns and portfolio risk.

## Steps to Complete
1. Import and clean the stock price data using Python.
2. Calculate daily returns and the covariance matrix.
3. Implement the Markowitz model to determine optimal portfolio weights.
4. Visualize the efficient frontier and analyze the risk-return tradeoff.
5. Generate a report summarizing the optimal portfolio allocation.

## Checklist
