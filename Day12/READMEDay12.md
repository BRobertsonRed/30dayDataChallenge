# Day 12 - Statistical Arbitrage Strategy

## Project Overview
In this project, youâ€™ll implement a statistical arbitrage strategy, focusing on pairs trading and mean-reversion techniques. The goal is to develop a strategy that identifies mispricings between correlated assets and executes profitable trades based on those discrepancies.

## Objectives
- Develop a pairs trading strategy using Python.
- Implement statistical tests for identifying cointegration.
- Backtest the strategy and evaluate performance.

## Dataset
- **Name:** Market Data
- **Source:** [QuantConnect](https://www.quantconnect.com/)
- **Description:** Historical market data used to identify trading pairs and test the statistical arbitrage strategy.

## Steps to Complete
1. Import and clean the dataset using Python.
2. Identify potential pairs by performing cointegration tests.
3. Implement a trading strategy based on mean reversion and pair ratios.
4. Backtest the strategy using historical data and evaluate performance metrics.
5. Generate a report summarizing strategy results and potential improvements.

## Checklist
- [ ] Download and clean the dataset.
- [ ] Perform statistical tests for pair selection.
- [ ] Build and backtest the trading strategy.
- [ ] Analyze performance and document findings.
