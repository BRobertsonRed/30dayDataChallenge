# Day 8 - Time Series Forecasting

## Project Overview
This project focuses on forecasting future values based on historical time series data. You will use Python to implement techniques such as ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing, which are commonly used in financial forecasting.

## Objectives
- Perform time series analysis using Python.
- Implement ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing models.
- Forecast future sales trends and visualize results.

## Dataset
- **Name:** Retail Sales Data
- **Source:** [Retail Sales Data (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manjeetsingh/retaildataset)
- **Description:** Historical sales data that includes information on revenue, product categories, and sales trends over time.

## Steps to Complete
1. Import and explore the dataset using Python.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and seasonality.
3. Implement ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing models for forecasting.
4. Evaluate model performance and fine-tune the parameters.
5. Visualize the forecast and generate a report summarizing the insights.

## Checklist
- [ ] Download and explore the dataset.
- [ ] Perform time series decomposition.
- [ ] Build and evaluate ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing models.
- [ ] Visualize and interpret the forecast results.
- [ ] Complete and document the project.
