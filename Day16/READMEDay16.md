# Day 16 - Building a Data Warehouse

## Project Overview
In this project, you’ll design and build a data warehouse to store and analyze large datasets. You’ll implement star and snowflake schemas, optimize data storage, and write queries for historical analysis.

## Objectives
- Design and implement a data warehouse schema.
- Optimize data storage using star and snowflake schemas.
- Write queries to analyze historical data.

## Dataset
- **Name:** Business Data
- **Source:** [Business Data (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sarahvch/stock-data-analysis)
- **Description:** Historical business data used to design and populate a data warehouse.

## Steps to Complete
1. Import the dataset into your data warehouse environment.
2. Design the warehouse schema using star or snowflake designs.
3. Populate the data warehouse with historical data.
4. Write queries to analyze and retrieve historical trends.
5. Document the warehouse design and key insights in a report.

## Checklist
- [ ] Download and explore the dataset.
- [ ] Design the warehouse schema.
