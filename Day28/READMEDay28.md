# Day 28 - Geospatial Analysis in Power BI

## Project Overview
This project involves conducting geospatial analysis using Power BI. You will use maps and location-based data to visualize and analyze trends across different regions, enabling better decision-making for location-based strategies.

## Objectives
- Conduct geospatial analysis using Power BI.
- Visualize location-based data using maps and heatmaps.
- Generate insights from geospatial trends and regional comparisons.

## Dataset
- **Name:** Sales Data with Geographic Coordinates
- **Source:** [Historical Data with Location Coordinates (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shree1992/historical-data)
- **Description:** Sales data with geographic information used to perform location-based analysis.

## Steps to Complete
1. Import the dataset into Power BI and clean the data.
2. Set up maps and visualizations to analyze location-based trends.
3. Build a dashboard that displays key metrics with geographic insights.
4. Generate insights on regional performance and strategy recommendations.
5. Document the findings and create a report.

## Checklist
- [ ] Download and clean the dataset.
- [ ] Set up maps and geospatial visualizations in Power BI.
- [ ] Build the geospatial analysis dashboard.
- [ ] Finalize and document the project.
