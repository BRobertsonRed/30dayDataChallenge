# Day 2 - Risk Analysis using Monte Carlo Simulation

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use Monte Carlo simulation to model financial risk. The focus is on predicting possible outcomes based on uncertainty in key financial variables like sales growth, market trends, and operational costs.

## Objectives
- Implement a Monte Carlo simulation in Excel.
- Analyze the distribution of potential outcomes.
- Generate a risk analysis report with key insights.

## Dataset
- **Name:** Stock Price Data
- **Source:** [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/)
- **Description:** Historical stock price data used to simulate future price paths and analyze risk.

## Steps to Complete
1. Download stock price data and clean it for analysis.
2. Set up the Monte Carlo simulation using Excel functions (e.g., `RAND`, `NORMINV`).
3. Run 1,000+ simulations and analyze the distribution of outcomes.
4. Visualize the results using histograms and other charts.
5. Prepare a risk analysis report with key findings.

## Checklist
- [ ] Download and clean the dataset.
- [ ] Set up the Monte Carlo simulation.
- [ ] Analyze and visualize the simulation results.
- [ ] Complete the risk analysis report.
