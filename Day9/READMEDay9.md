# Day 9 - Predictive Modeling for Customer Churn

## Project Overview
In this project, you will use Python to build predictive models that identify customers likely to churn. The goal is to apply classification techniques like logistic regression and decision trees to predict customer behavior.

## Objectives
- Build a predictive model for customer churn using Python.
- Apply logistic regression, decision trees, and other classification algorithms.
- Evaluate and optimize model performance.

## Dataset
- **Name:** Telco Customer Churn
- **Source:** [Telco Customer Churn (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
- **Description:** Customer data including demographics, service details, and historical churn information used to predict churn behavior.

## Steps to Complete
1. Import and clean the dataset using Python.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering.
3. Build predictive models using logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods.
4. Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
5. Generate a report with model insights and recommendations.

## Checklist
