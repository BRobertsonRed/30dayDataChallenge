# Day 22 - Web Scraping and Data Visualization in Python

## Project Overview
In this project, you will use Python to scrape data from websites and visualize the collected information. You will learn how to extract data using web scraping libraries like BeautifulSoup and Selenium and present the data using Python visualization libraries.

## Objectives
- Extract and clean data from websites using Python.
- Visualize the scraped data using libraries like matplotlib and Plotly.
- Build interactive visualizations and dashboards based on real-time data.

## Dataset
- **Name:** Real-Time Scraped Data
- **Source:** [BeautifulSoup Documentation](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)
- **Description:** Data scraped from websites in real time, covering topics such as stock prices, news headlines, or social media trends.

## Steps to Complete
1. Set up web scraping scripts using BeautifulSoup and Selenium in Python.
2. Extract and clean the scraped data for analysis.
3. Visualize the data using Python libraries like matplotlib and Plotly.
4. Build interactive dashboards and visualizations based on the collected data.
5. Document the web scraping process and insights in a report.

## Checklist
- [ ] Set up and run the web scraping scripts.
- [ ] Clean and preprocess the scraped data.
- [ ] Visualize the data using Python libraries.
- [ ] Finalize and document the project.
