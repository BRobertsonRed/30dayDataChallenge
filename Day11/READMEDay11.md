# Day 11 - Monte Carlo Simulation in Python

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform Monte Carlo simulation using Python to analyze risk and uncertainty in financial models. The focus is on simulating thousands of possible outcomes and evaluating the probability distribution of results.

## Objectives
- Perform Monte Carlo simulation using Python.
- Analyze the distribution of possible financial outcomes.
- Generate risk analysis reports based on simulation results.

## Dataset
- **Name:** Simulated Stock Data
- **Source:** [Simulated Stock Data (Investopedia)](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/montecarlo.asp)
- **Description:** Simulated stock price data used to perform Monte Carlo simulations and analyze risk.

## Steps to Complete
1. Generate or import the simulated stock price data using Python.
2. Set up the Monte Carlo simulation by defining variables and distributions.
3. Run 1,000+ simulations to model potential outcomes.
4. Visualize the simulation results using histograms and probability density plots.
5. Generate a risk analysis report with key insights and recommendations.

## Checklist
- [ ] Set up the simulated data in Python.
- [ ] Implement the Monte Carlo simulation.
- [ ] Visualize and interpret the simulation results.
- [ ] Complete and document the project.
